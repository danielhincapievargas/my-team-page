## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learn how to define variables in Sass:
```scss
$font-stack: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
$primary-color: #000000;
$hover-color: #cf649a;
$font-big: 18px;
$font-small: 14px;
```
I also learned how to nest:
```scss
.attribution{
    color: #333;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 10px;
    a{
        text-decoration: none;
        color: inherit;
        &:hover{
            color: $hover-color;
        }
    }  
}
```

I used the BEM methodology to create modifiers for some elements in different media queries:
```html
<div class="container__card container--second-layout container--third-layout">
  <figure>
    <img src="../assets/photo_2.png" alt="photo2">
    <figcaption>Saba Cabrera</figcaption>
    <span>ART DIRECTOR</span>
  </figure>
</div>
```

### Continued development

I didn't see the opportunity to use Modules or Mixins. I hope to be able to implement them in future projects to practice and learn more about them.

### Useful resources

- [Sass's guide page](https://sass-lang.com/guide) - On this page, I was able to refer to the basic syntax of what I used in Sass.
